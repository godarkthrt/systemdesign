# 🌐 Web Server vs 🧠 Application Server (Assuming backend Java/Spring developer)

As a backend developer building applications (lets say in Java/Spring Boot), it's important to understand the distinction between **Web Servers** and **Application Servers** — especially as your systems grow in complexity.

## 📘 Conceptual Difference

| Feature / Aspect           | 🌐 Web Server                                | 🧠 Application Server                          |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Role**           | Handles HTTP requests, serves static content | Executes business logic, runs application code |
| **Handles**                | HTML, CSS, JS, Images, Static Files          | APIs, Database Calls, Business Rules           |
| **Understands Java Code?** | ❌ No                                        | ✅ Yes (runs servlets, Spring controllers)     |
| **Example Technologies**   | NGINX, Apache HTTPD                          | Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, JBoss, WebLogic       |
| **Spring Boot Relevance**  | Optional (used in front for SSL, routing)    | Embedded (Spring Boot bundles one inside)      |
| **Content Type**           | Static                                       | Dynamic                                        |
| **Common Use Case**        | Serve website assets, act as reverse proxy   | Host and run Java web applications             |

## 🧱 How It Applies to Spring Boot

### ✅ Spring Boot Uses **Embedded Application Servers** (tomcat ideally is Web server + Servlet Container)

- When you build a Spring Boot app and run it with:
  ```bash
  java -jar myapp.jar
  ```

## Real World Architecture of Applications -

```
[Browser]
   |
   v
[NGINX Web Server]  <-- SSL termination, static file hosting
   |
   v
[Spring Boot App (Embedded Tomcat)]  <-- Runs your REST APIs, business logic
```
